# HTML & CSS Advanced Project ‚Äì CSS Styling Focus

## üìù Project Overview
This project is part of the **HTML Advanced module**, focusing on applying **CSS styling** to a web page.  
The goal is to recreate a professional landing page design from Figma, implementing:

- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Advanced CSS styling (layout, colors, typography, responsive design)
- Reusable components for tutorials, instructors, FAQ, and membership sections

The project emphasizes **pixel-perfect styling**, **responsiveness**, and accessibility.

- Translate Figma design into a responsive HTML page
- Apply modern CSS techniques for layout and styling

- Semantic HTML tags were used throughout the page.  
- Logos and images were added in the correct positions.  
- The page is tested for **responsiveness** on multiple screen sizes.
